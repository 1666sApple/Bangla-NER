          <h2>About Our Service</h2>
          <p>
            This is a web application that provides Named Entity Recognition (NER)
            and Part of Speech (POS) Tagging for text input in the Bengali
            language. <br />
            This was developed by
            <a href="https://github.com/1666sApple">1666sApple</a> as a part of
            the Bangla-NER project. <br />
            This project uses the Bangla-NER model, which is a pre-trained
            XLM-RoBERTa-base model for the Bengali language. <br />
            The model is trained on a dataset of Bengali text that contains
            about 7000 sentences and is able to accurately identify and classify
            named entities and parts of speech. <br />
            This model has achieved a POS Precision of about 93% and an NER Precision
            of about 92%.
