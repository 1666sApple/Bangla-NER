          <p>
            This is web application that provides Name Entity Recognition (NER)
            and Part of Speech (POS) Tagging for text input for Bengali
            language. <br />
            This was developed by
            <a href="https://github.com/1666sApple">1666sApple</a> as a part of
            the Bangla-NER project. <br />
            This project uses the Bangla-NER model, which is a pre-trained
            xml-roberta-base model for Bengali language. <br />
            The model is trained on a dataset of Bengali text that contains
            about 7000 sentences and is able to accurately identify and classify
            named entities and parts of speech. <br />
            This model has achived POS Precision of about 93.70% and NER
            Precision of about 92.56%
